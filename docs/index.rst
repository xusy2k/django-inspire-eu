The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure for the purposes of EU
environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This
European Spatial Data Infrastructure will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among
public sector organizations, facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe and assist in
policy-making across boundaries.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the Member
States of the European Union. The Directive addresses `34 spatial data themes <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Themes/Data-Specifications/2892>`_ needed for environmental applications.

The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007 and will be implemented in various stages, with full
implementation required by 2021.
